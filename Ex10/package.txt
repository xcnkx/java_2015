Which line of code will you need to add to each source file to put each class in the right package?

Package.java
import mygame.server.*;
import mygame.shared.*;
import mygame.client.*;

Server.java
package mygame.server;

Utilities.java
package mygame.shared;

Client.java
package mygame.client;


To adhere to the directory structure, you will need to create some subdirectories in the development directory and put source files in the correct subdirectories. What subdirectories must you create? Which subdirectory does each source file go in?

P1 <- Package.java
P1/mygame <- server
             shared
             client
P1/mygame/server <- Server.java
P1/mygame/shared <- Utilities.java
P1/mygame/client <- Client.java
 

Do you think you'll need to make any other changes to the source files to make them compile correctly? If so, what?

sharedを入っているクラスと同じ名前のutilitiesに変更する
